# weight-on-other-planets
A simple, quick fun project to practice my JS. Input a weight in lbs, displays the result under the planets <br>
Optimized for desktops, but I did some novice media query work in case you really wanted to use your phone :P
<br>
I took the idea from this site: https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/ <br><br>
Awesome idea and I enjoyed recreating it! 

# what I learned
I learned how to position grids with Bootstrap and create interactivity using JavaScript with the Bootstrap design.  <br>
This isn't all bootstrap, I only use fit for obvious design choices (the button, the grid layout). <br>
<br>
Reflecting, in the future I should and will be using more Objects rather than creating a bunch of variables.<br>
I needed a bit of help when trying to figure out the syntax for associating the calculations with independent results<br>
but in the end, I learned how to do just that and I learned a lot about the DOM as wel.
