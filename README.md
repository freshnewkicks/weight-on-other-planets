# weight-on-other-planets
A simple, quick fun project to practice my JS. Input a weight in lbs, displays the result under the planets <br>
Optimized for desktops, but I did some novice media query work in case you really wanted to use your phone :P
<br>
I took the idea from this site: https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/ <br><br>
Awesome idea and I enjoyed recreating it!
